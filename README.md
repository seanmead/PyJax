PyJax
=====

Easily create a Python webpage.  Ajax is used to replace linked content dynamically.  Scripts, styles and media are loaded automatically.

PyJax was created to make web development more modular.  Content and resources are automatically gathered and assembled.  Get/Post requests can be handled with html and/or Python methods.

PyJax will run on Linux, Mac, and PC with Python 2.7 installed.

The framework is ajax friendly.  Built-in scripts take care of site navigation.

Forward/backward navigation with the browser triggers content to load with ajax.
