        <p>PyJax was created to make web development more modular.&nbsp;&nbsp;Content and resources are automatically
        gathered and assembled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get/Post requests can be handled with html and/or Python methods.</p>

        <p>PyJax will run on Linux, Mac, and PC with Python 2.7 installed.</p>

        <p>The framework is ajax friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Built-in scripts take care of site navigation.</p>
